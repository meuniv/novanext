Requirement #1: Research and Reading
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note:: **What is a product?**  Until recently, the term was used only in relation to something material and often found in a retail store. Nowadays, it is coming to mean digital products as well. Apps and websites are modern products.
	  When it comes to building great products, design is the most important “feature.” We’ve moved into the stage where product design dominates — it’s what sets companies apart and gives a real edge over competitors.
	  Whether you’re a designer, developer, product manager, program manager, marketing manager or project manager, it’s essential to understand (and have a reference guide to) the product development process in order to create your best work (This note is inspired by this `article <https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/comprehensive-guide-product-design/>`__).
