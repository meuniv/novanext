.. note::  Product design describes the process of imagining, creating, and iterating products that solve users’ problems or address specific needs in a given market.

   The key to successful product design is an understanding of the end-user customer, the person for whom the product is being created. Product designers attempt to solve real problems for real people by using both empathy and knowledge of their prospective customers’ habits, behaviors, frustrations, needs, and wants (text adapted from this `site <https://www.productplan.com/glossary/product-design/>`__)
