.. note:: **The Wright Brothers**
	  
   The Wright brothers—Orville (August 19, 1871 – January 30, 1948) and Wilbur (April 16, 1867 – May 30, 1912)—were two American aviation pioneers generally credited with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful motor-operated airplane. They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft with the Wright Flyer on December 17, 1903, 4 mi (6 km) south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The Wright brothers were also the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible (Text adapted from `wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers>`__).

   If you travel to North Carolina, along the Atlantic shorelines, spend a few hours at the terrific museum, managed by the `US National Park Service <https://www.nps.gov/wrbr/index.htm>`__. As the website reminds the visitors: *They Taught the World to Fly!*
